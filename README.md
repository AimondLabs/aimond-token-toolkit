# aimond-token-toolkit
Official management toolkit for the Aimond (AMD) token

## Overview
This is for a web application and backend server that manage Aimond token distribution through a Loyalty Point program and an Aimond vesting program. Our other portals communicate with the backend server to create usersâ€™ loyalty points, which can later be converted to AMD tokens. The web application can create airdrops for our customers, release tokens related to loyalty points and airdrops, and create vesting schedules for beneficiaries like investors, founders, and employees. Our foundation owners can release the scheduled tokens to the beneficiaries.
